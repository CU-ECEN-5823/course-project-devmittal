## Home Automation - [Project Documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Xr8iJkr0jLGmn8_0hWulgEYgaV0E8OCy)

This project aims to automate a home by providing a level of convenience and security to the user. This project focuses on two pivotal areas of a home - the kitchen and the bedroom. In the kitchen, one node of the mesh is responsible for detecting fire and gas leakage. In case of a fire or gas leakage, a buzzer is sounded to alert the user to take action to prevent the fire/gas leakage. In the bedroom, a motion detector and a light intensity sensor on a low power node are used to automate the intensity of an LED located in the same room, thereby making a userâ€™s life convenient as they do not have to set the intensity of the light manually.

### Friend Node - [Individual Project Documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1KaiH6MU10pee8-20MCRns5au36piGTqI)

I will be developing the friend node as part of the application. The friend node will be responsible for receiving the sensor data from the two low power nodes. Its role in this application is to support the two low power nodes by ensuring that the two low power nodes consume as little power as possible by driving output based on data received. It has two actuators connected to it - a buzzer to sound an alarm in case of fire/gas leak in the kitchen which is supported by one low power node, and a PWM controlled LED which changes its intensity based on the motion of a person and the luminosity in a bedroom which is supported by the other low power node.
